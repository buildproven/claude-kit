# quality-status.sh — on-demand terminal diagnosis for an in-flight or
# stalled quality campaign (BUI-383).
#
# quality-terminal-status.js's buildDiagnosis() already produces a clear,
# structured report (repository gate status, provider review/checkpoint
# state, break-glass approval state, GitHub CI status) but was previously
# invoked only reactively from failure paths inside quality-run-gate.sh,
# quality-run-review.sh, and quality-stamp-and-merge.sh — all with
# best-effort `|| true` semantics tucked into error handling. There was no
# way to proactively ask "what's the state of my campaign?" without either
# waiting for a failure or manually reading the manifest JSON and `ps aux`.
#
# This script is that missing first-class entry point: read-only, no
# mutation, no new campaign, no discovery-by-glob. Matches the same explicit
# "the caller must pass the exact manifest path" convention already used by
# quality-bootstrap.sh's resume path and quality-load-root.sh — status must
# never guess which invocation is "the active one" from a PR number, session
# ID, or mtime.
