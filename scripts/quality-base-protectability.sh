# Decide whether a PR base is genuinely UNPROTECTABLE — i.e. the repository's
# plan cannot enforce branch protection at all — as opposed to protectable but
# unconfigured, or simply unobserved.
#
# Split out of quality-authorize-merge.sh so the classification is executable in
# tests. The distinction gates an escape hatch that permits merging without
# server-enforced strict base freshness, so a false "unprotectable" silently
# weakens the merge gate. Fail closed on every ambiguity.
#
# Usage: quality-base-protectability.sh --private <true|false|unknown> \
#          --rc <gh-exit-status> --body <gh-stdout-json>
#
# --body must be the API response body from STDOUT ONLY. Never pass output
# captured with 2>&1: interleaved stderr makes the body un-parseable as a single
# JSON document, and recovering a JSON fragment out of mixed text is exactly the
# response-injection hole this script exists to avoid.
#
# Exit 0 = unprotectable (escape hatch may open). Non-zero = protectable,
# unknown, or unobserved (must stay blocked).
