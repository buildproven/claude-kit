# The kit is consumed via symlinks: ~/.claude/<dir> -> <repo>/<dir>. Hooks in
# config/settings.json resolve through $HOME/.claude/scripts/..., so `scripts`
# is load-bearing — if it is not linked, every hook silently no-ops.
#
# Modes:
#   --check    verify every expected link; exit 1 if any are missing/broken
#   --repair   create or replace broken links, then re-verify
#   (no args)  same as --repair
#
# Never clobbers a real directory or a user's own file: if ~/.claude/<x> exists
# and is NOT a symlink, we warn and skip rather than delete their work.
