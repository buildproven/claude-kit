/**
 * Quality Run Governor
 *
 * /bs:quality has two nested autonomous loops: the BLOCKING-findings
 * auto-fix loop (Step 2.5, up to 3 attempts) and the Codex re-verification
 * loop (Step 2.6, CODEX_ROUNDS). CODEX_ROUNDS only bounds the inner Codex
 * loop — nothing bounded the OUTER cycle of fix -> re-review across a whole
 * invocation. Two PRs in one night ran 128min/6 commits and 167min/13
 * commits with no circuit breaker (2026-07-03 incident).
 *
 * This module is the run-wide governor every fix/round loop in SKILL.md
 * checks before doing another round of work. It tracks, against a
 * per-invocation JSON sentinel written by Step -1:
 *
 *   - review-round count (panels run since the run started)
 *   - fix-commit count (commits made since the run started)
 *   - active provider execution for manifests (legacy sentinels retain their
 *     original wall-clock contract)
 *   - repeated-finding-shape detection (same root-cause shape recurring
 *     across rounds, independent of which file it shows up in — see
 *     findingShapeKey), so a run doing N narrow variants of the same fix at
 *     different call sites can be told to batch-fix instead of treating
 *     each as a fresh round
 *
 * WHY THE ROUND COUNTER EXISTS (2026-07-10):
 * The original governor bounded commits and wall-clock but had NO round
 * dimension, and — more importantly — was never called on the review leg. Its
 * three call sites were all downstream of the panel (before a Codex round,
 * mid-Codex-poll, before a fix attempt). The "up to 3 attempts" cap on the
 * outer fix -> re-review cycle existed only as a sentence of English prose in
 * SKILL.md. Since the MODEL orchestrates that loop, an unenforced sentence is
 * not a cap. Consequences:
 *
 *   - 20min elapsed + 0 fix commits => `check` returned ok:true
 *   - a `check` passing at 29:59 could be followed by a 10min review panel and
 *     a 25min Codex poll => ~65min past a nominal "30min cap"
 *
 * `bump-round` is therefore called immediately BEFORE the review panel and
 * fails CLOSED at the cap. The model cannot argue with a non-zero exit code.
 *
 * Pure functions exported for unit testing — see
 *   scripts/__tests__/quality-run-governor.test.js

/**
 * `bump-round` — called IMMEDIATELY BEFORE the review panel runs (SKILL.md
 * Step 2.0). Increments rounds_used, persists, then evaluates every budget.
 * Returns the process exit code: 0 to proceed, 1 to halt.
 *
 * This is THE enforcement point for the outer fix -> re-review loop. Before it
 * existed, that loop's only bound was a sentence of prose in SKILL.md, and the
 * model — which orchestrates the loop — could and did run past it (128min and
 * 167min runs, 2026-07-03). Returning a non-zero exit code is the whole point:
 * a shell `|| exit 1` is not something the model can talk itself out of.
 *
 * Fails CLOSED on an unreadable or incomplete sentinel: a circuit breaker that
 * silently disables itself when its own state is untrustworthy is worse than
 * no breaker, because it reads as protection that isn't there.
