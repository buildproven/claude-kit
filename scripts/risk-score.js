/**
 * risk-score.js — kit-native review-depth scorer.
 *
 * Computes a 0–100 risk score for the current change from `git diff` alone, so
 * the quality skill can scale machine-review depth (Claude agent count, Codex
 * effort, Codex rounds) proportionally. Works in ANY repo with zero per-repo
 * setup: built-in defaults cover the common cases; a repo's harness-config.json
 * (scorePolicy/securityFloor/mergeAuthority) is merged over the defaults when
 * present.
 *
 * Why this exists: review is machine-only (Claude finds, Codex verifies) on
 * flat-rate subscriptions, so the real cost is wall-clock. Running the full
 * 6-agent + Codex-adversarial pass on a one-line comment change is pure waste;
 * skipping depth on a security-surface change is dangerous. The score scales
 * depth between those — but never to zero. Merge authority is a separate,
 * explicit policy: autonomous by default, with manual governance available as
 * an opt-in for repositories that need it.
 *
 * Design constraints:
 *   - Zero runtime dependencies (must run in 23 repos with no node_modules).
 *   - Deterministic + explainable (every score ships a `reasons[]` trail).
 *   - Conservative: mechanical/size heuristics can only LOWER score off a
 *     non-sensitive base, never below the security floor; magnitude only raises.
 *
 * Output (JSON to stdout, or GITHUB_OUTPUT lines when that env is set):
 *   { riskScore, taskType, changeNature, diffStats, reasons, knobs }

// Extensions whose contents are prose, not executable or credential-bearing
// material. A file with one of these extensions cannot reach the security floor
// on the strength of its NAME alone.
//
// Why: the floor patterns are deliberately token-broad (`**/*key*.*`,
// `**/*token*.*`, `**/*deploy*.*`) so that id_rsa, .p12, and oauth-config
// cannot evade them. Applied to prose, that same breadth misfires badly —
// `docs/monkey.md` matches `**/*key*.*`, and `docs/token-budget.md` matches
// `**/*token*.*`. Both scored 85 (critical band) purely because of a substring
// in the filename, which forced a full mutation + xhigh-Codex campaign onto a
// documentation edit and blocked the mechanical downgrade that would otherwise
// apply.
//
// This does NOT weaken the floor for credential MATERIAL. A .pem/.key/.p12/.env
// keeps the floor even under a prose suffix (see CREDENTIAL_STEM), prose inside
// a sensitive directory keeps it (PROSE_DIRECTORY_FLOOR), credential-shaped
// basenames keep it (hasCredentialToken + PROSE_NAME_FLOOR), and anything whose
// CONTENT is sensitive is still caught by the secret scanners.
//
// DELIBERATE TRADE-OFF, decided rather than inherited: prose *named after* a
// security topic — `docs/auth.md`, `docs/token.md`, `docs/deploy.md`,
// `docs/middleware.md` — does drop from the critical band to ordinary review.
// These are files ABOUT the protected surface, not the surface itself, and
// treating every such document as critical is what produced the 44%-critical
// rate this change exists to fix. Two things bound the risk: the human floor
// (touchesHumanFloor) is untouched and still catches them for manual-governance
// repos, and any real secret pasted into one is caught by content scanning
// rather than by its filename. Revisit by extending PROSE_NAME_FLOOR if a
// specific document turns out to warrant the floor on its name alone.
//
// One exception to the human-floor backstop: `middleware.*` is in
// DEFAULTS.securityFloor but NOT in DEFAULTS.humanFloor, so `docs/middleware.md`
// is off both. Accepted — a middleware design doc is genuinely prose — but
// stated here so the backstop is not read as universal.
