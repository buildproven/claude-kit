# Product-evidence admission operator guide

The source bundle contains a JSON request and a JSON array of changed paths;
Git paths include deletions and both sides of renames. NUL delimiters preserve unusual filenames.
Protected producer and admission API steps use the job-scoped GitHub token
with the permissions declared in each workflow.

## Final manual provisioning

This repository contains no private key. Generate two independent Ed25519 key
pairs in an approved offline or secrets-management environment:

- Store the base64 DER PKCS#8 producer private key as the GitHub Actions secret
  `PRODUCT_EVIDENCE_PRIVATE_KEY`.
- Store the base64 DER SPKI producer public key as the repository variable
  `PRODUCT_EVIDENCE_PUBLIC_KEY`.
- Store the base64 DER PKCS#8 admission private key as the GitHub Actions
  secret `PRODUCT_ADMISSION_PRIVATE_KEY`.
- Use the protected commissioning workflow to export the two public keys and
  their fingerprints. Verify the default-branch workflow commit, repository
  ID, run and attempt, successful conclusion, artifact digest, and public-key
  fingerprints through GitHub before constructing `product-trust.json`.
- Install the complete reviewed registry on each machine that can run
  `quality-run.js`. The installer checks the supplied digest after elevation
  and writes the root-owned registry atomically. Do not use a user-writable
  registry path.

  ```sh
  sudo node scripts/install-product-trust.js install <reviewed-staging-file> <sha256>
  ```

Do not place either private key in a repository variable, workflow output,
artifact, log, environment file, or local project configuration.

## Rotation

1. Create a new producer pair and a new admission pair.
2. Update the producer public repository variable and both protected secrets.
3. Record and approve an explicit registry rotation decision.
4. Commission and verify the new public keys, then install the complete
   reviewed registry on each operator machine.
5. Run a new exact-head admission. Old admissions fail after rotation by design.
6. Revoke the old secrets only after the new admission succeeds.
