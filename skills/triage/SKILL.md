# Triage — Production Errors → Linear → Worktree → PR

Production monitoring (Sentry/Datadog) feeds into agents that triage and propose fixes. You already have dev-time observability (cost tracking, trace coverage, ci-minutes audits). This skill adds **runtime** observability — what's actually happening in users' browsers and your servers.

## Prerequisites (one-time setup)

### 1. Sentry MCP server

```bash
# Claude Code — Sentry's hosted MCP at mcp.sentry.dev (HTTP transport)
claude mcp add --transport http sentry https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp

# Verify
/mcp
# Should show: sentry — connected
```

Auth: Sentry MCP uses OAuth — the first tool call triggers a browser flow to grant access to your org. Scoped tokens are stored in `~/.claude/.mcp-auth/`.

If Sentry MCP isn't yet stable or you prefer self-hosted: install `@sentry/mcp-server` from npm (Sentry maintains an official package) — fall back to API-token mode:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio sentry \
  --env SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=$SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN \
  --env SENTRY_ORG=$SENTRY_ORG \
  -- npx -y @sentry/mcp-server
```

### 2. Linear MCP

Verify with `/mcp` — should show `linear`.

### 3. Playwright (for synthetic journeys)

Required only for `/bs:triage synthetic` mode. Install in the target project:

```bash
npm install -D @playwright/test
npx playwright install chromium
```

## Usage

`/bs:triage` — pull errors from last 24h, cluster, report top 5 by impact
`/bs:triage --window 7d` — adjust lookback
`/bs:triage --project <slug>` — scope to one Sentry project
`/bs:triage --fix <issue-id>` — open worktree, propose fix PR for a specific Sentry issue
`/bs:triage --file-tickets` — file Linear tickets for top-N clustered errors
`/bs:triage synthetic init` — generate weekly synthetic journey for a product
`/bs:triage synthetic run` — run all synthetic journeys, post results to Linear

## Default mode: triage report

1. Pull issues from Sentry MCP: `mcp__sentry__list_issues(query: "is:unresolved age:-24h", limit: 50)`
2. Cluster by `culprit` + first frame of stack trace (errors with same root frame are one cluster)
3. For each cluster, compute:
   - `count` — events in window
   - `users_affected`
   - `first_seen` / `last_seen`
   - `is_regression` (has this fingerprint been resolved before?)
4. Score: `impact = log(count) * users_affected * (is_regression ? 3 : 1)`
5. Output table: top 5 clusters with score, link to Sentry issue, suggested action

Output format (concise, direct):

```
3 clusters worth your attention (24h window):

1. TypeError: Cannot read 'plan' of undefined  [score 142]
   src/billing/usage.ts:48 — 89 events, 31 users, regression (resolved 2 weeks ago)
   → suspect: rollout of changes in #482 reverted the null guard
   → action: /bs:triage --fix SENTRY-4821

2. ChunkLoadError /assets/main-abc123.js  [score 88]
   webpack runtime — 156 events, 22 users, new
   → suspect: stale CDN cache after deploy
   → action: investigate cache headers; not a code bug

3. PostgresError "duplicate key value"  [score 34]
   src/api/signup.ts:112 — 12 events, 12 users, new
   → suspect: race on email-uniqueness check
   → action: /bs:triage --fix SENTRY-4856
```

## --fix mode (proposed-fix worktree + PR)

For a specific Sentry issue ID:

1. Pull full issue from Sentry MCP: stack trace, breadcrumbs, user context, release version
2. Find the repo + commit that shipped the regression (via release tag in Sentry)
3. `bin/new-worktree fix-sentry-<issue-id>` in the relevant repo
4. **HUMAN PAUSE GATE**: present a one-paragraph hypothesis of root cause. Ask user to confirm before writing code.
5. After confirmation, implement minimal fix in worktree
6. Add regression test that reproduces the error
7. Run `/bs:quality --merge`
8. Open PR with body:

```markdown
## Fixes Sentry SENTRY-4821

**Root cause** (1 sentence)
**Repro** (commands or test)
**Fix** (1 paragraph — what changed and why)
**Regression test** (path to new test)
**Blast radius** (which users / flows affected)

Closes #<linear-ticket>
```

9. Link PR back to Sentry issue (Sentry MCP `link_pr` if available, else markdown link)

## --file-tickets mode

For top-N clustered errors that aren't already linked to a Linear ticket:

1. Search Linear for existing ticket containing Sentry issue ID
2. If absent, create with template:
   ```
   Title: [triage] <error message> — <count> events, <users> users
   Description:
     - Sentry: <url>
     - First seen: <date>
     - Suggested action: <auto-fix candidate? manual investigation?>
     - Stack trace: <code block, top 5 frames>
   Labels: bug, triage, sentry
   Priority: P0 if regression+users>50, P1 if users>10, else P2
   ```
3. Add Sentry issue ID as external link on the Linear ticket
4. Report tickets created/skipped

## Synthetic user journeys

A **weekly synthetic journey** exercises signup → core action → key conversion event for every product. This catches what unit and integration tests miss: env config drift, third-party API regressions, content/copy bugs, slow degradation.

### `/bs:triage synthetic init`

For a product:

1. Read `data/idea-lock/<slug>/one-customer.md` (if present) to know the core flow
2. Ask user: "What are the 3 actions a new user takes that prove the product works? (e.g. signup, run first analysis, view result)"
3. Generate `tests/synthetic/<slug>-journey.spec.ts` using Playwright
4. Generate `.github/workflows/synthetic-<slug>.yml`:
   - Trigger: `schedule: cron: '0 10 * * 1'` (Mondays 10am UTC)
   - Manual: `workflow_dispatch`
   - Job: install, run with **retry-on-flake** (see below), only-page-on-confirmed-fail
5. Commit to a branch and open PR for review

### `/bs:triage synthetic run`

Manual invocation (mostly for CI to call):

1. Run all `tests/synthetic/*.spec.ts` in the current repo with the **retry-on-flake protocol** (3 attempts, exponential backoff: 0s → 60s → 180s).
2. Only treat a journey as failed if **all 3 attempts fail**. A single transient failure (e.g. a Stripe API blip on a Monday morning) is suppressed; an attempt that recovers within the window is logged as `recovered_after_N_attempts` but not paged.
3. Collect results.
4. Post summary to:
   - Telegram (`mcp__telegram__send_message` or fallback to gh issue comment) — **only on confirmed fail** (3/3 attempts failed).
   - Linear (one ticket per confirmed failed journey, dedupe by week).
   - `data/synthetic-history.json` (every run, including `recovered_after_N_attempts` rows so flakiness is observable over time).
5. Exit code: 0 if all journeys pass _or recover_; 1 only on confirmed fail (3/3).

### Retry-on-flake protocol

Why three attempts with backoff:

- **One attempt** is what naive synthetic monitors do. They page on every blip, train you to ignore the page, then miss the real outage.
- **Three attempts with 0/60/180s spacing** filters out:
  - Network blips (resolved in <60s)
  - Third-party API transient errors (Stripe, Vercel deploys, DNS propagation — usually resolved in <3 min)
  - Cold-start latency on serverless backends after the synthetic hits a cold instance
- **Three failures in a row across ~3 minutes** is strong evidence of a real outage or regression, not noise.

CI implementation (in the generated `.github/workflows/synthetic-<slug>.yml`):

```yaml
- name: Run synthetic journey (retry-on-flake)
  shell: bash
  run: |
    set +e
    for ATTEMPT in 1 2 3; do
      if [ "$ATTEMPT" -gt 1 ]; then
        # 0s → 60s → 180s exponential backoff
        DELAY=$((60 * (ATTEMPT - 1) ** 2))
        echo "Attempt $ATTEMPT: waiting ${DELAY}s before retry..."
        sleep "$DELAY"
      fi
      npx playwright test tests/synthetic/ --reporter=line
      EXIT=$?
      if [ "$EXIT" -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "::notice::synthetic passed on attempt $ATTEMPT"
        echo "RECOVERED_AFTER=$ATTEMPT" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
        exit 0
      fi
      echo "::warning::synthetic attempt $ATTEMPT failed (exit=$EXIT)"
    done
    echo "::error::synthetic failed all 3 attempts — confirmed outage/regression"
    exit 1
```

Output `RECOVERED_AFTER` is consumed by a downstream step that decides whether to page (it never pages on recovery, only on confirmed fail).

## Budget gate (tier / time / tokens — NOT dollars)

Per-call dollar cost is opaque and changes per plan. Gate by tier and wall-clock budget so behavior is predictable regardless of billing:

```
About to:
  1. Pull issue context           — Sentry MCP, ~5 tool calls
  2. Generate root-cause hypothesis — 1 model call (Sonnet, ~2k tokens)
  3. Implement fix + regression test — coding loop in worktree (Opus, ~20k tokens, ≤10 min)
  4. Run /bs:quality --merge       — quality tier 'auto' + Codex judge if high-risk (≤15 min)

Budget caps:
  - max wall-clock: 30 min
  - max model tier: Opus 4.7
  - max judge tier: Codex high (if changed files match harness-config.json 'high'/'critical')
  - 7-day quota delta: ≤ 2% (read from ~/.claude/plugins/claude-hud/.usage-cache.json)

Proceed? [y/N]
```

If the current 7-day quota is already ≥80%, **refuse to proceed** unless `--force-budget` is passed — protects against runaway loops eating the weekly cap. Quota is read live from `~/.claude/plugins/claude-hud/.usage-cache.json` (per memory `feedback_health_check_autofix.md`).

`--auto` for CI runs **still applies the budget caps** — it skips the interactive prompt, not the caps. Runaway protection is non-negotiable.

## Anti-patterns this skill refuses

1. **Silent fixes**: every `--fix` PR must include a regression test. Refuse to open PR without one.
2. **Linking without context**: don't file Linear tickets without stack trace + user count.
3. **Auto-closing Sentry issues** without a deploy that actually fixed them.
4. **Synthetic journeys covering the happy path only**: ask the user to include at least one failure-path check (e.g., expired-card on checkout).
5. **Triage without timebox**: refuse to run if user has >20 open `triage`-labeled Linear tickets — clear backlog first or it's a noisy signal.

## Hook integration (optional — for advanced users)

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json` PostToolUse hook:

```json
{
  "matcher": "Bash",
  "hooks": [
    {
      "type": "command",
      "command": "bash $HOME/.claude/scripts/triage-hook.sh"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Status: not implemented.** `scripts/triage-hook.sh` does not yet exist. If you add this hook line to settings.json without the script existing, Claude Code will silently swallow the missing-file error on every tool call. **Do not add the hook entry until the script ships.**

When implemented, the script will batch agent tool calls + costs into a daily summary, feeding the observability loop. Tracked separately — file a Linear ticket if you want this before the next quality cycle.
