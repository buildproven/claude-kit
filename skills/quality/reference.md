# Quality Reference — Flags, Scopes, Levels, and Modes

## Target Resolution (Step -1)

### Invocation manifest and isolation

Bootstrap creates one schema-versioned JSON manifest and prints its exact path.
Every later entrypoint requires `--manifest <that-path>` and validates the
repository realpath, PR, base SHA, and expected HEAD before reading or writing
state. There is no session sentinel, active-state glob, mtime lookup, or
`latest` pointer.

`scripts/quality-run.js --manifest <exact-path>` is the public phase runner.
It persists versioned orchestration progress under the same manifest lock and
reuses exact-head gate, mutation, and review evidence on resume. Its JSON result
is `complete`, `terminal`, `action-required`, or `work-required`. Exit 3 is
reserved for a named external capability or branch-governance action. Exit 4
requests bounded local lead verification or remediation and must resume the
same manifest. Gate, stale-head,
provider-contract, CI, and signal
failures retain their typed terminal state and one idempotent telemetry record.
An exhausted incomplete review cannot become `verified-unmerged`; it records
`provider-incomplete`. Merge success requires exact-head `merged` terminal
evidence from the protected merge transaction, not only process exit zero.

Risk resolution also records a deterministic task type from the branch commit
range and, when commit intent is unavailable, an all-specialized path set:
`docs`, `ci`, `build`, `chore`, `feature`, `bugfix`, `performance`, or
`unknown`. Feature work imposes the standard floor. Bug-fix and performance
labels alone do not impose a high-review floor. Task routing can raise review
depth but never lower path, magnitude, or security floors. The initial type is
reused while advancing the same campaign so remediation commit labels do not
change its identity or budget.

The state directory is:

```text
$TMPDIR/bs-quality/<repo-hash>/pr-<number|none>/<base-sha>/<invocation-id>/
```

Provider artifacts add `reviews/<head-sha>/round-N/`. Safe resumption is
explicit and accepts only a descendant HEAD. Each successful checkpoint
records its exact `from..to` range and diff hash, allowing fix rounds to review
only `previousReviewedHead..currentHead` while final evidence remains bound to
the complete base/final-HEAD relationship.

Merge authority is distinct from review depth and is persisted in the manifest
at risk resolution. The global default is `autonomous`: a clean critical review
merges without a human hop. Quality stops rather than merges when findings,
provider output, CI, revision identity, or review coverage are unresolved.

Repositories that need manual governance can explicitly set
`scorePolicy.mergeAuthority` to `human-required`. Only that opt-in enables
break-glass approval: a signed outer-wrapper capability bound to repository key,
PR, HEAD, invocation ID, approver, issue time, and expiry. Nested autonomous
quality processes have no approval-mint command. HEAD changes and expiry fail
closed.

**Bug fixed 2026-05-11**: when invoked as `/bs:quality --merge` with PR
context in the natural-language args (e.g. `#410`, `codex/foo`, or a
worktree path), prior versions ignored those references and audited
whatever happened to be in the operator's cwd — producing irrelevant
reports about uncommitted changes in the primary checkout. Target
resolution (in `scripts/quality-bootstrap.sh`, calling
`scripts/quality-target-resolver.js`) honors, in priority order:

1. **Explicit PR number** in args (`#NNN`, `PR NNN`, `pr#NNN`, `pull/NNN`, or
   `--pr NNN`) — `gh pr view <N> --json headRefName` resolves the head
   branch, then we look up the local worktree.
2. **Branch name** in args (e.g. `codex/foo`, `feat/bar`) or via `--branch`
   — find the local worktree for that branch.
3. **Worktree path** via `--target-dir <path>` / `--target <path>` /
   `--worktree <path>` or any bare absolute-path arg that exists.
4. **cwd is a non-primary worktree** — audit cwd's diff vs base ("I'm
   working in my feature branch worktree" case).
5. **Fallback: primary checkout** — only with a LOUD warning. **Forbidden
   under `--merge`** — `--merge` hard-refuses to fall through to (5).

The parsing + resolution logic is pure and unit-tested at
`scripts/__tests__/quality-target-resolution.test.js`; the bootstrap script
calls it as a subprocess and acts on the JSON result. If no local worktree
exists for a resolved PR/branch, `scripts/worktree-manager.js` materializes it
under the canonical sibling `.worktrees/<repo-name>/<branch-slug>` container,
so repeat invocations reuse it deterministically.

## Reviewer Provider Policy

Claude Code, Codex, and the opt-in Gemini quality adapter read the shared workflow policy at
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/buildproven/agent-providers.json`. Configure it
with `scripts/provider-config.sh --primary codex --fallback claude`
(or reverse the providers). Gemini is accepted only by the quality-specific
policy surface; select it explicitly with `BS_QUALITY_PRIMARY=gemini` or
`BS_QUALITY_FALLBACK=gemini`. The Gemini leg runs the installed `gemini` CLI in
bounded, read-only plan mode and validates its JSON response against the same
strict review schema as Codex. `BS_QUALITY_PRIMARY`, `BS_QUALITY_FALLBACK`, and
`BS_QUALITY_PROVIDER_CONFIG` are per-run overrides. The fallback runs for typed
account exhaustion (HTTP 429, weekly/rate/usage limit, exhausted quota), an
unavailable CLI, or — when `BS_QUALITY_FALLBACK_ON_TIMEOUT=1` (the default) — a
primary that exhausts its bounded review clock without converging (a degraded
primary shouldn't block a merge while a healthy fallback is idle). It does NOT
run when the primary reports code findings.

For the Wave 3 comparison, `--review-arm native` assigns Codex primary with
Claude fallback and `--review-arm bespoke` assigns Claude primary with Codex
fallback. Bootstrap persists both the assigned arm and resolved provider order
at campaign creation. Telemetry records the assigned arm, actual reviewer,
effort, nullable provider token count, and explicit artifact character/token
estimates separately; provider fallback therefore does
not corrupt intent-to-treat attribution. Campaigns without an explicit arm
keep ordinary provider policy and infer the received arm from the actual
reviewer.

Selected Claude reviewers share a cancellation sentinel: the first exhausted
reviewer causes sibling process groups to terminate. Medium and High select
one reviewer by changed-domain evidence; Critical selects `code-reviewer` plus
one distinct domain specialist or the reliability backstop. Every selected
reviewer must return usable evidence. A successful review records HEAD; later
fix rounds use that SHA as their diff base so unchanged commits are not
reviewed again. Bootstrap clears this state for every new invocation.

When structured exhaustion metadata includes a reset timestamp, quality prints
that timestamp and the exact manifest-bound retry command. The terminal
diagnosis reports repository gates, provider checkpoint, merge-authority state,
and GitHub CI separately; it does not flatten quota, parser, billing/auth,
code-finding, and CI failures into one generic merge message.

### Remote dispatch claim retention

Protected-check dispatch claims use lightweight Git refs under the versioned
`buildproven-dispatch-claim-v3/` and `buildproven-dispatch-claim-v3-meta/`
namespaces. The deterministic claim ref remains the atomic cross-host nonce
claim; the separate timestamped metadata ref records the issue time. Creating
metadata before the claim means a losing race leaves no unreferenced Git
object. Prune
expired claims with the bounded operator command (default retention: 24 hours):

```bash
node scripts/quality-required-checks.js cleanup-claims --repo owner/name
```

The cleanup command deletes only expired annotated claim refs. It retains
claims with missing or invalid metadata and never deletes legacy lightweight
claim refs in the original `buildproven-dispatch-claim/` or v2 namespaces.
Those legacy refs are quarantined and do not suppress v3 claims. Run cleanup from a
scheduled maintenance process, not from every quality invocation.

## Test execution

The runner resolves persisted gate commands and invokes `quality-run-gate.sh`.
Use the repository-owned test-impact plan. Unknown coverage is an actionable
mapping failure unless the repository explicitly declares an audit fallback.
Do not manually rerun a failed test command in a shell retry loop. Diagnose the
failure and resume the exact campaign under its remaining repair budget.

Working-tree task hooks use the same selector when configured. Their result is
local feedback, never signed exact-head review or product-completion evidence.
Repositories without a selector retain their own test command, without adding
runner-specific flags. Configure a selector to avoid that legacy full audit.

## Flags

| Flag                                 | Default | Description                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `--scope S`                          | branch  | Revision-bound branch scope; other values fail fast                                          |
| `--merge`                            | false   | Auto-merge PR after quality                                                                  |
| `--skip-tests`                       | false   | Skip hard test gate (config-only repos)                                                      |
| `--verify-app`                       | false   | Add the `verify-app` gate: boot the app and browser-check the root page (BUI-306, see below) |
| `--pr <number>`                      | -       | Bind to one open PR                                                                          |
| `approve --pr <number> --head <sha>` | -       | Legacy `human-required` policy only: mint signed approval for one exact PR/HEAD              |
| `--manifest <path>`                  | -       | Resume one exact persisted invocation; accepts no other flags                                |
| `--target-dir <path>`                | -       | Run against this repo (use when invoking from a forked/agent context with no inherited cwd)  |

### `--verify-app` gate (BUI-306)

Every deterministic gate up to this point (lint/type/build/test/security/
consumer) proves the code compiles and its own test suite passes — none of
them boot the app, so "green" has never meant "the thing runs." `--verify-app`
closes that gap by discovering an additional `verify-app` required gate,
implemented in `scripts/quality-verify-app.sh` and invoked exactly like every
other gate through `quality-run-gate.sh` (same recording, same reuse-on-
unchanged-HEAD, same evidence contract). It is opt-in only — never discovered
without the flag — because booting a real process/browser is slower and more
environment-sensitive than a static gate.

Project-type detection is `package.json`-only, in this order:

- **web** — `scripts.dev` or `scripts.start` exists, the process binds a
  discoverable port, and an HTTP probe of that port returns HTML. The gate
  drives `agent-browser` (see `skills/agent-browser/SKILL.md`) to load the
  root page, then reads `agent-browser errors --json` and
  `agent-browser console --json` and fails if either reports a JS error /
  `console.error`.
- **server** — a dev/start script exists but the booted port does not answer
  with HTML (JSON API, gRPC, raw TCP, ...). The gate only requires the
  process to bind its port and stay alive past the boot window; no browser
  is invoked.
- **CLI** — no dev/start script, but `package.json#bin` is set. The gate runs
  `<bin> --help` and requires a clean exit.
- **library** — none of the above. There is no runnable entrypoint, so the
  gate exits 0 immediately with a "not applicable" message. It cannot use the
  manifest's `status: "skipped"` path — `quality-invocation.js`
  `gateEvidenceInput` hard-restricts that status to the `test` gate only, so
  every other required gate (including `verify-app`) must report `success`
  or `verifyGateEvidence` blocks the campaign. A library therefore records a
  genuine clean pass, not a skip.

Port discovery order: `.quality-app-flows.json`'s `"port"` field, then a
literal `PORT=<n>` / `--port <n>` / `-p <n>` / `:<n>` found in the dev/start
script string, then the conventional default `3000`. Boot and page timeouts
default to 45s/30s and are overridable via `QUALITY_VERIFY_APP_BOOT_TIMEOUT`
and `QUALITY_VERIFY_APP_PAGE_TIMEOUT`.

The zero-config baseline — root page loads, zero JS errors, zero
`console.error` — requires no repo opt-in beyond `--verify-app` itself, per
BUI-306's own "no per-repo config bloat" resolution. A repo that wants deeper
checks may declare 1+ named flows in a `.quality-app-flows.json` at the repo
root:

```json
{
  "port": 3000,
  "flows": [
    {
      "name": "login",
      "steps": ["open /login", "wait --load networkidle", "click @e1"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Each step is one literal `agent-browser` subcommand + args (no shell
metacharacters, no chaining); the gate runs each step in order and fails the
same way as the baseline load if any step exits non-zero or the flow leaves
behind a JS error. This file is entirely optional — its absence is not an
error and does not change the baseline check.

A repository can also override the gate's command entirely via
`.quality-gates.json`'s native-gate policy (`gates.verify-app`, same schema as
every other native gate name); the script above is only the default.

| `BS_QUALITY_ALLOW_UNPROTECTABLE_BASE` | `false` | Accepts non-atomic base freshness on a private repo whose plan cannot enforce branch protection at all. See below.                                                                                     |

### `BS_QUALITY_ALLOW_UNPROTECTABLE_BASE` (base-protection escape hatch)

`scripts/quality-authorize-merge.sh` normally requires the PR base to carry
server-enforced strict required-status checks (classic branch protection or an
equivalent ruleset) before it will authorize a merge. That guarantee is
**atomic**: GitHub itself refuses to advance the base out from under the merge,
so the reviewed diff and the merged diff are provably identical.

Some plans can't supply that guarantee at all — most commonly a **private**
repo without the GitHub tier/rulesets needed to configure required-status
checks. On such a repo, strict protection isn't "unconfigured", it's
unconfigurable, and the gate would block every merge forever.

Setting `BS_QUALITY_ALLOW_UNPROTECTABLE_BASE=true` lets `quality-authorize-merge.sh`
proceed anyway, but only after it proves the repo genuinely can't protect the
branch — never merely that protection is off. That classification runs in
`scripts/quality-base-protectability.sh`, which requires all of:

- the repo is private (`gh api repos/<repo>` `.private == true`) — a public repo
  can always be protected, so this alone fails closed;
- the branch-protection API call itself failed (non-zero `gh` exit status);
- the failure body is a genuine plan-limit response, parsed by
  `scripts/quality-parse-plan-limit.js` from a STDOUT-only capture (stderr is
  never merged in, so a malformed or injected body can't be recovered into a
  well-formed one).

Any other outcome — API error, rate limit, ambiguous body, unreadable
response — is treated as "protectable or unknown" and the merge stays
blocked. The classifier fails closed on every ambiguity by design.

**What's weakened when it's on:** the base-freshness check becomes
best-effort instead of atomic. The base branch can advance between the
review and the merge landing, so the diff GitHub actually merges is no
longer guaranteed identical to the diff that was reviewed. This is an
accepted, narrowly-scoped trade for repos with no other option — leave it
unset unless `quality-authorize-merge.sh` reports the base as unprotectable
on your plan.

### Protected non-strict ref-CAS

A protected branch with non-empty required checks and GitHub `strict: false`
is not unprotectable. A clean campaign with `mergeAuthority=autonomous` may use
the protected non-strict ref-CAS path without an operator prompt only when the
repository commits `scorePolicy.protectedNonstrictRefCas` as
`"accept-non-atomic-pr-state"`. The default is `"signed-only"`. The explicit
policy accepts the unavoidable concurrent close-or-retarget race once instead
of asking on every later green PR. Risk resolution reads it from the exact
protected-base commit, binds that source SHA in the manifest, and the lease
re-reads the same revision at the mutation boundary. A candidate cannot add the
authority that it consumes. `mergeAuthority` is resolved and rebound from that
same base policy so a candidate cannot remove manual governance either. The lease
independently rechecks complete exact-head review and gates, green required
checks, App bindings, the complete classic-protection digest, resolved
conversations, exact identity, and ancestry immediately before its non-force
update.

The separate signed `operator-nonstrict-refcas-override` remains the exception
path. During a classified Actions billing outage, it binds `ci:failed` and the
exact outage artifact. If provider discovery is exhausted, the same capability
also binds `review:provider-exhaustion`. Every included condition requires its
category-specific acknowledgement; two separate capabilities cannot be
composed after signing.

For an exception, the final repository lease reloads the signed capability and
requires enough remaining validity for the bounded request. For the autonomous
green path, it reruns provider-neutral review authorization and required CI
validation. Both paths recheck the live base, protection digest, administrator
permission, immediate PR identity, head ancestry, and every required review
conversation. The direct immutable-head integration cannot atomically bind a
concurrent PR close or retarget. It updates only the exact base ref to the exact
reviewed head through GitHub's ref API with `force: false`. A verified
non-fast-forward rejection releases only the short operation guard and keeps
the campaign lease resumable. Any other uncertain response stays quarantined
until exact integration or exact closed-without-merge state is proven.

### Run Governor (runaway-loop guardrails)

Two PRs run in one night (#529: 128min/6 commits, #532: 167min/13 commits)
completed with no circuit breaker — `CODEX_ROUNDS` only bounds provider
discovery, not the outer cycle of lead → deterministic verification → fix →
delta discovery across the whole invocation. `scripts/quality-run-governor.js`
tracks governor state inside the explicit invocation manifest with:

#### Fixed-cost repository gates

Diff size controls review depth and the initial per-gate slice. Test selection
is independent: the repository's test-impact evidence chooses the smallest
affected set, reports unmapped paths instead of guessing, and uses a complete
suite only for an explicit audit. A micro change therefore retains a
120-second planned check slice plus enough bounded reserve when a legitimate
audit gate needs it.
The shared ledger is allocated up front for the initial exact head and the one
permitted remediation head, so advancing after review cannot mint more time.
Within each pass, time used by lint or another gate reduces what remains for
tests. Nothing becomes unbounded: a hung command is killed at the smaller of
its slice plus reserve and the remaining global gate ledger, and the governor
still permits at most one fix commit. This floor prevents tiny changes in
repositories with large integration suites from timing out solely because the
diff is small (BUI-389).

- **Fix-commit cap** (`BS_QUALITY_MAX_FIX_COMMITS`, default and hard maximum
  1. — one batched remediation commit, checked before every fix attempt and
     verification. Environment configuration may lower this cap but cannot raise
     it. The review-round and provider-attempt hard maxima are 2 under the same
     rule.
- **Proportional phase caps** — changed lines plus 25 units per changed file
  select a micro/small/medium/large/huge band. The whole default campaign is
  capped at 900 seconds. Critical discovery receives up to 540 seconds based on
  measured xhigh review latency; lower-risk discovery and the single
  verification reserve remain workload-scaled inside that campaign cap.
- **Two-review convergence** — one discovery review and one targeted
  delta discovery are allowed. A deterministic failure discovered by
  verification is reported as the terminal result; it cannot trigger another
  fix/review recursion.
- **Repeated-pattern detection** — findings are recorded round-over-round;
  if a round's findings mostly repeat a shape seen in an earlier round (e.g.
  the same on-disk-vs-loaded-job gap at 4 different call sites), the skill is
  told to batch-fix every matching call site in one commit instead of
  spending a separate round per occurrence.
- **Live status** — every round prints `[quality] elapsed Xm/Ym, fix-commits
N/M` so the operator can see the loop's position in real time, not just in
  the final summary.

**On a tripped cap**, the skill hard-stops autonomous continuation — no
further rounds, no `--merge` — and hands back a plain-text summary of what
was tried and why it did not converge. Repeating the unchanged request resumes
the same exhausted campaign; environment changes cannot mint a replacement
budget. A code finding must be addressed in a new commit and reviewed as a new
HEAD. The skill never raises its own cap.

**`BS_QUALITY_TARGET_DIR` usage**: when a spawning harness (e.g. a Task agent
running in an isolated worktree) exports this env var, every forked
`/bs:quality` invocation in that scope auto-targets the right repo without
needing `--target-dir` on each call. Prevents the "forked skill silently
scanned the agent's cwd" failure mode.

### Campaign telemetry (closed-loop value measurement)

At the terminal step (SKILL.md Step 6), the public `quality-invocation.js
terminal-state` command automatically asks `scripts/quality-telemetry.js` to
append one JSON line per finished campaign, summarizing the invocation manifest
— no model judgment. Fields: invocation id, repo/PR/branch, base/head SHAs,
resolved risk tier + score, wall and active duration, exact provider-reported
token usage when available, separately labeled artifact estimates, successful
review rounds, agents run, review status, signed per-finding dispositions,
deterministic failure count, merge-requested flag, exact merged terminal receipt,
a derived verdict, and the covered file list (`baseSha..head`). Recording is
idempotent for each invocation and terminal state. A later verified merge may
append one stronger `merged` receipt; readers select the latest record for that
invocation. Writes are fail-soft and never block the campaign outcome. Reports
exclude preflight, `vitest/*`, and missing-repository records by default; use
`--include-fixtures` only for explicit diagnostics. Missing usage and finding
settlements remain visible sample gaps, never inferred as zero or relabeled from
artifact estimates.

### Exact-head review evidence

When `--merge` is used and the quality pipeline ran in the same invocation
(Step 1.8 completed), the merge gate (Step 4) publishes a signed
`quality-review-evidence` check run on the reviewed HEAD. The payload binds the
reviewed HEAD, merge-base, risk tier, deterministic findings, selected reviewers,
and v2 policy/diff evidence when present. Publication is idempotent and never
creates an empty commit or force-pushes the PR branch. Final authorization
verifies the check run on that exact HEAD before the protected merge.

Existing campaigns that already persisted an empty stamp continue through the
legacy trailer path so an interrupted merge can resume without creating a second
stamp. New campaigns must not create or require one.

If the pipeline did NOT run in this invocation (e.g. operator passed
`--merge` alone with no prior quality work), the gate hard-blocks instead
of publishing evidence — publishing then would be forging review evidence.

## Scope

`branch` is the only executable scope: the manifest binds the merge-base and
HEAD, gates run from committed policy, and review covers that exact range.
`changed` and `all` fail at bootstrap until they have distinct, testable
execution semantics.

## Quality Levels

`auto` resolves risk from the exact diff and repository policy. Low risk uses
zero AI reviewers and a signed policy-exempt record. Medium/high select one
reviewer; critical selects two Claude reviewer slots when Claude is used. Codex
uses its tier-specific review depth. Provider counts are not six/ten-agent panels.

`95` and `98` are supported minimum risk scores (50 and 75 respectively), not
percentage-quality promises or alternate workflows. See
`quality-risk-resolve.sh`, `quality-select-agents.sh`, and the persisted plan.

Gates, mutation, review, fallback and repair spend the shared active campaign
budget. CI/approval wait is distinct from active execution. Resume does not grant
a fresh budget. Use exact campaign status for the resolved limits.

## Provider Invocation

Codex uses the native `codex exec review` surface with the scorer-selected
`model_reasoning_effort`; this avoids ambient-effort drift and avoids pasting
the repository diff into a generic prompt. Current Codex versions return
native priority-marked review text even when `--output-schema` is supplied, so
the runner normalizes that format into the same strict internal finding schema.
`quality-run-bounded.sh` places it in a process group and enforces the tier cap:

```
codex exec --ephemeral -s read-only --json \
  -c 'model_reasoning_effort="high"' --output-schema <schema> \
  review --base origin/main
```

The runner normalizes native review text, root-level structured output, and the
legacy `{result: ...}` envelope before parsing findings. It pins the exact
merge-base SHA before starting the first provider so a fetch in another linked
worktree cannot move `origin/main` and inject reverse-diff findings. Later
rounds review from the last successfully reviewed SHA. Claude uses the same tier
timeout around each parallel reviewer and cancels sibling process groups on
account exhaustion. Gemini receives the exact revision identity and committed
diff on stdin, uses one or two workload-selected static-analysis passes, runs
with `--approval-mode plan`, and fails closed on malformed, contradictory, or
unstructured output.

## Trailer Convention

```
Reviewed-By: quality
Reviewed-By: codex
Quality-Tier: high
Quality-Reviewer: codex
Quality-Primary: codex
Quality-Fallback: claude
Quality-Findings: 0
Quality-Head: <SHA>
Quality-Base: <SHA>
Quality-Contract: 2
Quality-Policy: <policy-digest>
Quality-Agents: <selected-agent-set-hash>
Quality-Domain: <selected-domain>
Quality-Selection: <selection-rule>
Quality-Repository: <repository-key>
Quality-Diff: <complete-base-to-head-diff-hash>
Quality-Review-Evidence: <artifact-chain-hash>
```

- `Reviewed-By: quality` is the provider-neutral authorization record.
- `Quality-Reviewer` records which reviewer actually completed; it can differ
  from `Quality-Primary` when fallback was required.
- Every trailer required by the campaign's contract version is present exactly
  once. `Quality-Findings` is the integer `0`, and `Quality-Tier` must meet the
  recomputed risk tier. Version 2 binds the effective policy, selected agents,
  domain rule, repository, complete diff, and retained review artifacts.
- Legacy `Quality-Head` must equal HEAD or HEAD~1 (a dedicated stamp commit),
  and `Quality-Base` must equal the current merge-base. Any later code commit
  invalidates that legacy stamp. New campaigns use the signed exact-head
  `quality-review-evidence` check run instead and do not emit these trailers.
- Parenthetical `Reviewed-By` metadata is legacy reader compatibility only and
  must not be emitted by new quality campaigns.
- **Legacy authorization path is queryable from the trailer; new authorization
  is queryable from the exact-head check run, with no telemetry inference
  needed.** A version-2 Low campaign uses a signed `policy-exempt` artifact
  with `aiReviewRequired: false`; it never synthesizes a clean provider
  verdict. Medium and above require completed evidence from every selected
  reviewer.

## Merge Flow (`--merge`)

The deterministic runner owns the complete path. Only
`quality-stamp-and-merge.sh` may perform the authorized merge transaction after
exact-head gate, review, admission and required CI evidence. Verify the persisted
merged receipt, then use owner-bound worktree cleanup. Never substitute a direct
merge command, skip CI, or treat review-ready as merged/product-done.

Legacy audit, teams and parallel-panel recipes are not executable modes of this
revision-bound runner. Use a separate advisory review workflow when requested;
it cannot grant merge authority.

### Worktree lifecycle locks: recovering a stale cross-host lock

`scripts/worktree-manager.js` serializes create/lock/unlock/remove/reconcile
operations per worktree with a directory-based lock
(`withLifecycleLock`) at:

```
<repo-common-dir>/worktree-manager/locks/<hash-of-branch>.lock/
  owner.json   # { pid, hostname, operation, key, createdAt }
```

On a stuck lock, `worktree-manager.js` can only prove the owning process is
dead when `owner.hostname` matches the current machine's `os.hostname()` — it
then signals the recorded `pid` with `kill(pid, 0)` and reclaims the lock if
that fails with `ESRCH`. If the lock was left by a process on a **different
host** (e.g. that host crashed, or the lock was created in CI or another
worktree environment before the box died), there is no way to verify
liveness, so the lock is deliberately retained forever rather than guessed
stale — every lifecycle operation on that worktree fails with
`LIFECYCLE_BUSY` until it's cleared. This is a conservative choice (never
falsely reclaim a lock that might still be held), not a data-loss risk.

**Manual recovery**: once you've independently confirmed the owning host/process
is actually gone, remove the stale lock directory directly:

```bash
rm -rf "<repo-common-dir>/worktree-manager/locks/<hash>.lock"
# or, to clear every lock for the repo:
rm -rf "<repo-common-dir>/worktree-manager/locks"
```

`<repo-common-dir>` is `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` for the repo (the
shared `.git` dir, not a linked worktree's private gitdir). There is currently
no CLI flag for this — `worktree-manager.js help` does not mention the lock
directory, and removal is a manual filesystem operation only.

## Next action

For a completed merge, report the exact receipt and next authorized item.
For a blocked run, report its typed cause and exact manifest resume path.
Do not restart an exhausted campaign or improvise a new panel to seek approval.
